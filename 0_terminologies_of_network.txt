1.  Network Protocols -> Rules or Regulations of setup for Communication and share information over a Network.



2.  Packets ->  
                In order to send data over computer Network, We can't send all or big chunk data at once.
                We need to divide the data in smaller chunks, These small chunks are called Packets.


3.  Address ->  Sending data over a Network requires a unique destination Address on Network. That's called Address in CN.



4.  Port ->     
                Port helps you in getting packets to a specific process on the host.
                To deliver a packets to correct process in computer, We need port.

                IP + PORT = SOCKET

                Range of port -> 0 - 2^16 = 65535 ports are available.

                0 - 1023 -> Well known Ports (80 is for http and 443 is for https)

                1024 - 49152 -> Register Ports (Any third party can use these range) (postgres - 5432, mongo - 27017)

                49152 - 65535 -> Dynamic Port (We can use it as well) least uses
