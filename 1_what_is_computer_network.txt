A Computer network is a system that connects numerous independent computers allowing them to share messages from one computer to another.

Different Layers of Computer Network

    1.  Physical Layer -> (Physical layer)

        1.  This layer adds start and end delimiters to the message. (These delimiters tell where the message starts and ends).
        
        2.  This layer also encodes the message based on the time interval and the voltage.

    
    2.  Routing Layer -> (DataLink layer, Network layer, Transport layer)

        1.  The process of sending message source to destination using intermediaries is known as routing.

        2.  This layer is useful when sender knows where to send this messages.

        3.  While sending the message, the sender also includees the receiver's address in the message.

        4.  Then this address is decode by router and send this message to destination.



        To route message correctly to destination, sender gives destination ip and also broadcast their it's ip in some cases (if receiver wants to message back, they can do it easily).

        MAC address -> This is like the identity of the computer system. It is permanent.
        IP address -> This is a virtual/logical/temporary address.


    3.  Behavioral Layer -> (Session layer)

        1.  This layer defines the conversation settings between two or more computers.

        2.  This layer answer question like :-

            1.  How frequently can one computer send messages to another?

            2.  Can the receiver after receiving a message, send a reply to the sender?

            3.  Can the receiver send a message without receiving any message?


        3.  So we are defining the frequency, directions and context of messages in this layer.
