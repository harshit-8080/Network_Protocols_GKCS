1.  SMTP (Simple mail transfer protocol) is used to send mail that are stored in user's inbox.

2.  POP3 is used to retreive mail, That are stored on user's sent box.

3.  These box (SMTP and POP3 work together) and uses TCP as lower protocol.

4.  SMTP is push protocol and POP3 is pop protocol.



SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

    1.  When a user sends a mail, It's send to sender's SMTP server.
    
    2.  User SMPT server places this emails to message queue.
    
    3.  Now Sender's SMTP server starts iniating connection with receiver's SMTP server and conducts a handshake (in case when sender and receiver's SMTP servers are different).
    
    4.  Now finally it sends the email to receiver's SMTP server.

    5.  As a last Step, Email will be downloaded from receiver's SMTP server and client shows the email.

    6.  Sender's SMTP also retry in case of failure while sending mail.



POP3 - Post Office Protocol -

1.  Users love this protocol for its low dependency on Internet connections. Useful even in  Internet connection is unstable or even unavailable

2.  POP3 downloads emails from the server to the client so you can read them even offline. 

3.  The server deletes messages once they are retrieved. (insures privacy) This is the default and common setting.


Phases :->

    1.  The client connects to the server (AUTHORIZATION State).

    2.  The client retrieves email (TRANSACTION State).

    3.  The server deletes the stored messages (UPDATE State).

    4.  The client disconnects from the server.



IMAP4 (Internet Message Access Protocol)

1.  Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a communication standard to access email stored on the server.

2.  The key feature of this protocol is that the message remains on the server.

3.  It will be downloaded as soon as the recipient picks it to open.

4.  So, IMAP gets access to the email from any device or location if authorized.
