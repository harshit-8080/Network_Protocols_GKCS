Both Http and websockets uses TCP protocol as core protocol.

Regarding Http and It's feature :->

    1.  This is the most common way to request and receive response. It stands for Hyper Text Transmission Protocol.

    2.  Http protocol is stateless. It means every request is independent and doesn't have any relation or related to old requests to server.

    3.  It's typical client and server protocol. Where every client request will have request ID and server needs to respond.

    4.  In http protocol, Server can't request to client. It's unidirectional communication.




Regarding WebSockets and It's feature :->   

    1.  Since http was unidirectional, If we wants to have bidirectional communication, We can use WebSockets.

    2.  It allows for peer-to-peer communication, So it establishes a duplex connection.

    3.  In peer-to-peer communication, Both devices can send and receive requests.

    4.  We can also use xmpp (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol), Which is open xml technology for real-time communication.
