Question -> What happens when we enter a URL let's say -> www.facebook.com

Answer ->
    1.  First of all, Computer sends this info to NIC (network interface card -> a hardware deive in computer).

    2.  This is NIC allows the computer to connet to router.

    3.   This Router doesn't know about the bussiness domanin that's why i asks Central authority or DNS or Internet Backbone.

    4.  This DNS has the mapping of bussiness domanin name to an ip address.

    5.  After the router gets the ip address from DNS, It's connects to facebook server. BUT HOW ??

    6.  client Router goes to the server from router to router, At every router we get address of next router, And finall it reach to facebook server.

    7.  Now facebook server needs to send the response back to client router with similar process.





Question -> Now router has the response, But There can be multiple device connected to that router ?
            So how router knows which device it need to send response.

 Answer ->
    1.  The Router sends the sender address when sending the request to server.
    
    2.  We use NAT (Network Address Translation).

    3.  Every device has a unique ip address inside the network which is given by router. (DHCP)
    
    4.  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks.

    5.  So router knows which ip has ask this info or who requested this info.
